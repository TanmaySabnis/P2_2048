# P2_2048
Created my first UI based game, although in very raw state and with basic functionalities, it was extremely fun to implement 

2048 is a very interesting and interactive game to play.

The aim is to generate a '2048' tile by merging tiles which start from 2.

The basics of this project stem from 2 main components: 1. the logic 2. the UI

##### Logic:

The logic part includes various functionalities like:

1. Create a Grid

2. Compress the grid

3. merge the grid

4. Transpose the grid

5. Reverse the grid

These 5 functionalities when implemented by logic and in various combinations make it possible to move up, move down, move right, move left.

Apart from this the code contains an UI which is implemented using Tkinter library.

Hope you like it!
